Lie with me by the fire
We can be safe from the storms up high
There's a winter ahead, if it's cold and wet
We're always warm here side by side
Come what may, change of heart, who can say?
If you look in my eyes
For the moon and the stars, hearing strumming guitars
Well, I admit that it'd be nice
I'll be with you until the spring runs by
And the summer starts to burn
I'll be with you when the autumn wind returns
Don't you want to say you'll stay?
Lie with me by the fire
We can be safe from the storms up high
There's a winter ahead, whether it's cold and wet
We're always warm in paradise
Paradise
I'll be with you until the spring runs by
And the summer starts to burn
And I'll be with you when autumn returns
Yes, when all the seasons turn
Come what may, change of heart, who can say?
If you look in my eyes
For the truth in my heart from a world far apart
You'll realize where you can find
Paradise, mm-mm
Paradise
