Yeah
Sweet dreams come after hours, nothin' that's not allowed
You should never sleep alone (sleep alone)
'Cause I'll always take you home (yeah, right)
When there's nothin' left but diamond necklace (uh-huh) on you, girl
I just wanna love you like, love you like, love you like that (yeah)
Love you like, love you like, love you like that (yeah)
Love me right, love me right, love me right back (yeah)
Love me right, love me right, love me right back
You should never sleep alone 'cause I'll always take you home
When there's nothin' left but diamond necklace on you, girl (oh)
Any night, any time, you are my appetite
Double vision, Gemini, and it goes like this
Take you home, take it slow, 'til you bite your lip
Got a movie in my mind, and it goes like this
Closed curtains, open eyes
Lay down your skin on mine
Leave all the rest to me (yeah)
Sweet dreams come after hours (that's what they do)
Nothin' that's not allowed (uh-huh)
You should never sleep alone (sleep alone)
'Cause I'll always take you home (yeah, right)
When there's nothin' left but diamond necklace on you, girl
I just wanna love you like, love you like, love you like that (yeah)
Love you like, love you like, love you like that (yeah)
Love me right, love me right, love me right back (yeah)
Love me right, love me right, love me right back
You should never sleep alone 'cause I'll always take you home
When there's nothin' left but diamond necklace on you, girl (oh)
You the only cover that I need when I'm cold (cold)
You can have my body, with my heart and my soul (soul)
You light up my life, you're like a diamond
Shinin', shinin', shinin', yeah
And we might never get to sleep tonight
I'll give you everything you need tonight
This kind of love, I guarantee for life
Dreams gonna be sweet tonight (oh, yeah)
Sweet dreams come after hours, nothin' that's not allowed
You should never sleep alone (sleep alone)
You should let me take you home (alright)
Till there's nothing left but diamond necklace (yeah) on you, girl
I just wanna love you like, love you like, love you like that (yeah)
Love you like, love you like, love you like that (yeah)
Love me right, love me right, love me right back (yeah)
Love me right, love me right, love me right back
You should never sleep alone 'cause I'll always take you home
When there's nothin' left but diamond necklace on you, girl (oh)
