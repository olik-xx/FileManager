We have to fight only trying to survive
Dead friends are behind you and me
Hands with the fire, jump to the sea
Only go higher you and me
We haven't fight just trying to survive
Anyone alive? You and me
Hands with the fire (fire), jump to the sea
Go down or higher? Ask you and me
Everyday is yesterday
We don't look back
Go forward with no regrets, we, the young
Forever mercy (ooh, ooh)
Everyday is yesterday
We don't look back
Meaning's always meaningless, we, the young
Forever mercy (ooh, ooh)
슬픔은 늘 떼로 온다
기쁨은 늘 스쳐 간다
슬픔은 늘 떼로 온다
기쁨은 없다
Everyday is yesterday
We don't look back
Go forward with no regrets, we, the young
Forever mercy (ooh, ooh)
Everyday is yesterday
We don't look back
Meaning's always meaningless, we, the young
Forever mercy (ooh, ooh)
